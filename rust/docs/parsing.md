## Parsing in Log Surgeon
Log Surgeon parses log data using a [Parsing Specification][parsing-spec].
The parsing specification includes:

- How root rules are matched.
- How subrules are extracted.
- How log events are separated.

The specification is the main entry point: [`ParsingSpec::create_parser`][create-parser] creates a
parser, and there may be many independent parsers per specification.
A parser advances through the input and builds structured log events,
using a lexer to identify matches in the input according to the parsing specification.

### Matching Root Rules
The lexer identifies occurrences of root rules defined in the parsing specification.
A root rule match represents a piece of semantically meaningful text identified by the user.

The lexer processes input left to right.
At each step, it attempts to match root rules according to the following:

- The longest possible match.
- If multiple root rules match with the same length,
  the highest-priority (earliest) rule in the spec is selected.

If no root rules match at the current position,
the parser seeks to the first delimiter character after the current position,
and the lexer repeats attempting to match a root rule _after_ the delimiter.

WIP: We hope to generalize root rule matching
to find the earliest possible occurrence of a root rule at each step.

#### Implementation Details
To determine if/what rule matches from an input position,
Log Surgeon builds an [automaton][dfa]
for the combination of all root rule patterns in the parsing specification;
an automaton is just a state machine with transitions based on an input character.
Specifically, Log Surgeon implements the classical regex -> NFA -> DFA construction.

DFAs simulate matching multiple patterns/rules at once,
performing only a single pass through the input.
"Executing" the DFA is a loop that traverses the states:

```rust
let mut current_state: usize = 0;
let mut maybe_match: Option<(Rule, usize)> = None;
for (pos, ch) in input.char_indices() {
	if let Some(next_state) = states[current_state].lookup_transition(ch) {
		current_state = next_state;
		if let Some(rule) = states[current_state].accepting_rule {
			// Save the match, but don't stop yet; see if we can match longer.
			maybe_match = Some((rule, pos + ch.len_utf8()));
		}
	} else {
		break;
	}
}
return maybe_match;
```

Note: The theoretical complexity of determining whether input matches
is very different from finding the longest possible match;
longest match semantics inherently requires "looking ahead" to attempt a longer match,
even if the extra input does not result in a match.
In practice, the non-static text of logs is small compared to the static text,
and confirming the longest possible match for rules in a parsing specification
rarely require consuming much extra input.

Notice that each iteration of the loop
requires looking up the transition for the current state and input character.
Specifically, characters are Unicode code points (with fast lookup for those in the ASCII range).
Additionally, at each step, we check if the current state is an accepting state.
In a sense, this DFA loop is an "interpreter" for instructions "record match" and "goto next state".

##### Submatch Extraction
The classical DFA execution determines which rule matches;
once the rule and matched text is known,
Log Surgeon uses a [tagged DFA][tagged-dfa] for the specific rule to extract sub-rule matches.
Conceptually, a tagged DFA is just a DFA with operations to execute on state transitions;
in this case, the operations record sub-rule match positions.
Compared to the pseudocode for a classical DFA above,
the inner loop just changes by:

```rust
if let Some((next_state, operations)) = states[current_state].lookup_transition(ch) {
	execute_operations(operations);
	// Rest is the same.
	current_state = next_state;
	if let Some(rule) = states[current_state].accepting_rule {
		maybe_match = Some((rule, pos + ch.len_utf8()));
	}
} else {
	break;
}
```

Note: While it is possible to build a single tagged DFA
for all the rules in the parsing specification,
executing this DFA to determine the root and sub-rule matches at once means
executing all the state transition operations for all the potential rule matches;
i.e. recording many potential sub-rule matches that are discarded.
Therefore, we have found it better to execute a classical DFA to determine which rule,
and a tagged DFA specifically for the matched rule.

### Separating Log Events
While lexing input, to determine log event boundaries, newline characters (not part of a rule match)
and root rules named `header` are treated specially under the following conditions.

A `header`, if preceded by a newline (or at start of input), is a log event separator.
Otherwise, it is treated as an ordinary rule.

If no separating `header` has been encountered (yet), log events are separated on newlines.

Newlines are part of the line preceding it;
in other words, log events are always terminated by newlines
(but a newline doesn't necessarily terminate a log event).
