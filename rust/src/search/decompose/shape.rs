//! A coarse model of a log shape.
//!
//! A log shape is a sequence of static text and references to rules (variables).
//! [`ShapeModel`] keeps that structure,
//! pairing each variable with a [`Charset`] bounding the characters the rule can emit,
//! plus the sub-rule(s) needed to report a capture.
//!
//! The model is built from [`ParsingSpec::split_log_shape`],
//! the same tokenizer [`ParsingSpec::automata_for_shape`] uses,
//! so the model and the automaton can never disagree about where the variables are.
//!
//! # Preconditions
//!
//! A shape is expected to be *decomposable*:
//! every variable must name a rule the spec defines,
//! and every such rule must be a **leaf** (no nested captures).
//! Both are asserted when the model is built,
//! so callers never have to ask whether a shape can be decomposed -- the type says it can.
//! Violations are programming errors in the shape, not conditions to recover from;
//! see [`ShapeModel::new`].
