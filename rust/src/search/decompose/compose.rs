//! Composes [`Placement`]s into whole-shape decompositions.
//!
//! # The DP
//!
//! A [`Composition`] chooses one placement per run such that the chosen placements run
//! left to right and do not overlap. The state is `(run index, earliest usable part)`
//! and every placement advances both, so the state space is a DAG and is solved
//! by a reverse sweep -- the same structure as [`crate::search::decompose::prefilter`],
//! and the reason feasibility can be decided in `O(runs x parts x placements)`
//! even when the number of compositions is large.
//!
//! Enumeration is separated from feasibility ([`crate::search::decompose::can_compose`]),
//! so that a shape can be *rejected* cheaply, and only a shape that survives pays for
//! materializing its decompositions. A [`ComposeBudget`] caps enumeration,
//! so a pathological shape degrades to "no conclusion" instead of exploding.
//!
//! # Positional identity
//!
//! Each [`Capture`] names the **index of the shape part** that produced it,
//! so two references to the same rule in one shape are distinguishable
//! even when they share a name.
//!
//! [`Composition::to_interpretation`] renders that positionally:
//! every rule reference up to the last constrained one contributes a sub-query,
//! with unconstrained references appearing as a bare `*`. The position of a capture
//! among those variables is what identifies which reference it is,
//! so `A%foo%B%foo%C` distinguishes its two `foo`s by whether a vacuous `foo=*`
//! precedes the constrained one.
//!
//! Static text is reported even where the query does not constrain it, as a `'*'`
//! sub-query, so the output has the same shape as the engine's
//! and [`crate::search::SearchString::search_by_name`]'s: a run split across static text
//! and a rule yields one sub-query for each. This is pure rendering -- the parts and
//! their attribution are already known, so no automaton or simulation is involved.
//!
//! A static sub-query's value must glob-match its part's text *exactly*,
//! so a run covering only part of a stretch is padded with `*` on both sides;
//! see [`symbolic_value_of`], which decides this from where the pieces sit
//! rather than from whether the part is a rule.
//! Compositions that differ *only* in where pieces sit within static text
//! are one decomposition, and are merged; see [`merge_by_padding`].
//!
//! References *after* the last constrained capture are omitted when the query is not
//! anchored at the end: its trailing wildcard leaves them unconstrained,
//! so they add nothing. Their static text is still reported,
//! since that is where the trailing wildcard applies;
//! if the rendering ends in static text, that value gets a trailing `*` for them.
