//! Places a query's literal runs into a log shape, and composes those placements into
//! decompositions.
//!
//! # The two stages
//!
//! **Placement** (per run, per position): where can this run go? A run must be produced in full,
//! and there are only three possibilities -- inside one rule, inside the shape's static text,
//! or straddling a boundary between a rule and what sits beside it. Each possibility is decided
//! from a cached [`RunFit`] (rule side) or a substring search (static-text side), so the cost
//! is independent of how much static text the shape contains.
//!
//! If any run has no placement anywhere in the shape, the shape **cannot** match and is rejected
//! immediately, without touching an automaton.
//!
//! **Composition**: choose one placement per run such that the placements occur left to right
//! and do not overlap. This is a reachability problem over `(run index, shape position)` --
//! every placement advances both -- so it is solved by the same kind of reverse DP sweep as
//! [`crate::search::decompose::align`], in `O(runs x positions x placements)`, rather than by
//! enumerating choices.
//!
//! # Positional identity
//!
//! A decomposition records the **index of the shape part** that produced each piece, not just
//! the rule name. Two references to the same rule in one shape (`A%foo%B%foo%C`) are therefore
//! distinguishable, which the engine's own output is not: it reports both as `foo` with the
//! same group, leaving the instance to be inferred from position among vacuous captures.
