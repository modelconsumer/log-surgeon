//! Which shapes `search_by_log_shapes` supports, and what it does with the rest.
//!
//! A shape is **supported** when every variable names a rule the spec defines and that rule is a
//! leaf.
//! Unsupported shapes are a programming error, not a condition to recover from,
//! so the search panics with a message naming the shape and rule
//! rather than silently answering differently from the engine.
//!
//! A shape with *no* variables (pure static text) is supported:
//! its text is exactly what a query must reproduce,
//! which placement and composition already handle.
