//! A query is anchored at a boundary exactly when it has no wildcard there.
//!
//! The rule is uniform across both ends: `foo*` is anchored at the start, `*foo` at the end, `foo` at
//! both (an exact match), and `*foo*` at neither. Both ends are expressed the same way -- as a wildcard
//! the automaton actually consumes -- and the cost of the unanchored case is controlled by bounding how
//! much of the shape is built, not by stopping the intersection early.
//!
//! These tests pin the semantics through the public entry point, so they cover `decompose`, the
//! composition path, and the engine together.
